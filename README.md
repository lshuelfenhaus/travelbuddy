# TravelBuddy
## Senior Project for B.S. Software Engineering 
### San Jose State University

This project acts a a "travel buddy" by allowing the user to search and book flights and hotels. We have also added a chatbot assistant for the user to interact with Chat-GPT

This project is for educational purposes and is not intended to serve as an actual platform for travel.
